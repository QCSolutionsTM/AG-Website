                <h2>Meet the Business Owner: Emilio F.</h2>
                <p>I graduated high school and I was invited to go roofing by one of my uncles. I still went to college and got my degree in graphic design but when I finished college there werenâ€™t a lot of jobs (2008 market crash) so I decided to keep working with my uncle.</p>
                <p>Eventually I got my own crew and I decided to get my Construction labor contracting license which is not a CCB License but I was able to find labor for my uncle and other contractors who needed the guys. And then finally in July of 2017 I decided to go for it and got my own CCB License and now I run 3 roofing crews, one gutter crew, and a couple siding crews.</p>
